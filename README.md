# Analyzing What Makes an Effective Leader

## What-Makes-an-Effective-Leader:

Why are some managers better than others? Are there any general behaviors or characteristics that help a leader be perceived as more effective? The data I use in this analysis was given to me by Seth Berry and originates from a large survey of employees and their direct manager. In this dataset, each leader provided self-ratings and their direct subordinates provided rating about the leader. This is reflected by the `Rater` variable.  The data is structured the following way:

The *forceful* scale contains the following subscales: takes charge, declares, pushes

The *enabling* scale contains the following subscales: empowers, listens, supports

The *strategic* scale contains the following subscales: direction, growth, innovation

The *operational* scale contains the following subscales: execution, efficiency, order
